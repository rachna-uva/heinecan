Folders in this submission:
--------------------------------------
machine_learning

This folder contains the Jupyter notebook "paper_nlp.ipynb", in which Named Entity Recognition (a process in Natural Language Processing,  which is a subfield of machine learning and artificial intelligence) was used to get a starting point for heat stress mitigation measures, to be used the digital intervention. 138 research papers were analyzed in this program (they are contained the subfolder "papers"). A network graph was also generated to visualize the relationship between heat conditions and mitigation measures.

You can open the Jupyter notebook using VSCode or Jupyter Lab (in Anaconda Distribution), and view the saved outputs. If you wish to run the entire program, please keep in mind the package dependencies, which have been explained in the beginning of the notebook.

hsmd_website

This folder contains the website files for the digital intervention we developed, called the Heat Stress Mitigation Dashboard (HSMD). The website was developed using HTML, JavaScript, DOM, chart.js, and Papa Parse.

You can open the landing page of the website ("index.html") directly in your browser by double-clicking on it; if that doesn't work, alternatively, you can open "index.html" with a Live Server on VSCode. 

A third way to view our website is by copy-pasting this link into your browser:
