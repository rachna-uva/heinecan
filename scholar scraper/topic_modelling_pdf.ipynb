Even with optimum mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions, human activity has set a future climate change trajectory that will inevitably lead to far worse exposure to extreme heat than the present day for much of the planet’s population. The health impacts will be concentrated, as they are now, among populations and regions where the risks are largely unnoticed and inadequately addressed: older people (>65 years); those with comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and renal disease; and people with lower socioeconomic status. Excessive heat in workplaces is a serious health hazard for employees across a range of industry sectors. Employers also pay a heavy price through lost productivity due to reductions in cognitive and physical work performance, and large increases in sick leave. Society must adapt in ways that not only enable it to survive, but thrive, in a much hotter future. Therefore, the global community and policy makers should look beyond \n",

Since AMSTAR-2 was developed for syntheses of systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials, working with a team member with expertise in knowledge synthesis (AT), we adapted it to suit a research context that is not amenable to randomised controlled trials. For instance, we changed assessing and accounting for risk of bias in studies’ included randomised controlled trials to assessing and accounting for limitations in studies’ included articles.

      "To the best of our knowledge, the current study provides the first broad overview of previous systematic reviews exploring the health impacts of climate change.

First, by targeting system-atic reviews, we achieve a higher order summary of find-ings than what would have been possible by consulting individual original studies. Second, by synthesising find-ings across all included studies and according to the combination of climate impact and health outcome, we offer a clear, detailed and unique summary of the current state of evidence and knowledge gaps about how climate change may influence human health. This summary may be of use to researchers, policy-\n",

      "It is important that the medical professions play a signif-\n",

Rigorous and expertanalysis of the available data documenting absolute andrelative benefits and risks of those procedures and thera-pies can produce helpful guidelines that improve theeffectiveness of care, optimize patient outcomes, andfavorably affect the overall cost of care by focusingresources on the most effective strategies.\n",
      "The American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the\n",
      "American Heart Association (AHA) have jointly engaged inthe production of such guidelines in the area of cardiovascu-lar disease since 1980. This effort is directed by the ACC/AHA Task Force on Practice Guidelines, whose charge is todevelop and revise practice guidelines for important cardio-vascular diseases and procedures. Writing committees arecharged with the task of performing an assessment of theevidence and acting as an independent group of authors todevelop written recommendations for clinical practice. Ex-perts in the subject under consideration are selected from bothorganizations to examine subject-specific data and write orupdate guidelines. The process includes additional represen-tatives from other medical practitioner and specialty groupswhere appropriate. Writing groups are specifically charged toperform a formal literature review, weigh the strength ofevidence for or against a particular treatment or procedure,and include estimates of expected health outcomes wheredata exist. Patient-specific modifiers, comorbidities, and is-sues of patient preference that might influence the choice ofparticular tests or therapies are considered, as well as fre-quency of follow-up and cost-effectiveness. When available,information from studies on cost will be considered; however,review of data on efficacy and clinical outcomes will be theprimary basis for recommendations in these guidelines.\n",

      "1.2. Definitions\n",
      "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) encompasses a range ofnoncoronary arterial syndromes that are caused by thealtered structure and function of the arteries that supply thebrain, visceral organs, and the limbs. Numerous pathophysi-ological processes can contribute to the creation of stenoses\n",
      "or aneurysms of the noncoronary arterial circulation, but ath-erosclerosis remains the most common disease processaffecting the aorta and its branch arteries. These guidelinesprimarily address the diagnosis and management of athero-sclerotic, aneurysmal, and thromboembolic PAD. \n",
      "Whereas the term “peripheral arterial disease” encompass-\n",
      "es a large series of disorders affecting arterial beds exclusiveof the coronary arteries, this writing committee chose to limitthe scope of the work of this document to disorders of theabdominal aorta, renal and mesenteric arteries, and lowerextremity arteries. The guideline is thus presented as anintroduction, followed by 4 sections that address theseanatomic arterial regions. Clinical management guidelines\n",
      "for other arterial beds (e.g., the thoracic aorta, carotid and\n",
      "vertebral arteries, and upper extremity arteries) have beenexcluded from the current guideline to focus on the infradi-aphragmatic arterial system and in recognition of the robustevidence base that exists for the aortic, visceral, and lowerextremity arteries. The guideline is also organized to followan anticipated “chronology” of clinical care of patients withPAD. As such, the full-text guideline is written with the pre-sumption that many readers will search the guideline for spe-cific advice on management of PAD patients at differentphases of their illness. Thus, in selected instances, recom-mendations and some portions of the text are repeated.\n",
      "The clinical manifestations of PAD are a major cause of\n",
      "acute and chronic illness; are associated with decrements in\n",
      "functional capacity and quality of life; cause limb amputa-tion; and increase risk of death. The systemic nature of theatherosclerotic process also contributes to development ofconcomitant disease of the arteries to the heart and brain.Consequently, patients with PAD often face an associatedincreased risk of cardiovascular ischemic events, such asmyocardial infarction (MI), ischemic stroke, and death.Overall, the manifestations of PAD are thus associated witha large personal, social, and economic burden in the UnitedStates, Europe, South America, and Asia, and PAD isincreasingly recognized as a health burden worldwide.\n",
      "Inasmuch as the burden of PAD is widespread, these guide-\n",
      "lines are intended to assist all clinicians who might providecare for such patients. In particular, these guidelines aredesigned to aid primary care clinicians, vascular and cardio-vascular specialists, trainees in the primary care and vascularspecialties, nurses, physical therapists, and rehabilitative per-sonnel who seek clinical tools that can improve the properevaluation and management of patients with PAD and asso-ciated thromboembolic disease.

Thus, this termencompasses a myriad of pathophysiological syndromes thataffect the arterial, venous, and lymphatic circulations;accordingly, it includes all vascular diseases that alter end-organ perfusion. Arterial diseases include those disordersthat cause either fixed obstruction or abnormal vascular reac-tivity of the arteries that supply a given tissue; the obstruc-tion impairs blood delivery and can produce ischemia.Venous diseases include those disorders that impair normalvenous function, usually involve both altered venous struc-ture and function, and may include thromboembolism. Thesedisorders include venous valvular incompetence and venoushypertension, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonaryembolism, the postthrombotic syndrome, and varicose veins.Lymphatic diseases are a consequence of congenital oracquired processes that may cause progressive destruction orabnormal function of the microvascular lymphatic networks;these disorders are usually clinically manifested as lym-phedema. Thus, the term “peripheral vascular disease” isbroadly inclusive of all vascular disorders.\n",
      "The term “peripheral arterial occlusive disease” is used in\n",
      "a manner analogous to that of PAD, although it specificallyexcludes the functional (vasoreactive) or aneurysmal disor-ders that affect the noncoronary arteries. “Lower extremityarterial disease” includes disorders that affect the leg arteriesand does not include diseases of the aorta, carotid, upperextremity, or visceral arteries. \n",

      "For the purposes of this guideline, we utilize the term\n",
      "“peripheral arterial disease” to broadly encompass the vas-cular diseases caused primarily by atherosclerosis and\n",

      "Peripheral arterial disease may also be caused by degener-\n",
      "ative disorders that lead to a loss of the structural integrityand subsequent dilation of the arterial wall. The pathophysi-ology of some specific progressive arterial degenerative dis-eases is relatively well understood (such as the collagenabnormalities that underlie Marfan and Ehlers-Danlos syn-dromes) (6-10), whereas the vascular defect responsible formost degenerative diseases remains elusive (e.g., Erdheim’scystic medial necrosis, arteriomegaly, neurofibromatosis,and most of the so-called atherosclerotic aneurysms).Arterial wall degeneration can lead to aneurysm formation ordissection that may result in arterial rupture or occlusion. The most common dysplastic disease is fibromuscular dys-plasia (FMD), which may affect many noncoronary arterialbeds, especially the renal arteries, carotid arteries, and iliacarteries (11,12). The vasculitic diseases may also affect anyarterial bed, and the spectrum of clinical syndromes associ-ated with vasculitis is broad (13-20). Large vessels (the aortaand its first- and second-order branches) may be involved bygiant cell arteritis (Takayasu’s disease), Behçet’s syndrome,relapsing polychondritis, and vasculitis associated witharthropathies. Medium-sized vessels (conduit musculararteries and branches) are classically the target of polyarteri-tis nodosa or temporal arteritis (a form of giant cell arteritis),although Wegener’s or lymphoid granulomatosis, Churg-Strauss syndrome, and Kawasaki disease also affect vesselsof this size. Radiation-associated arteritis can affect vesselsof any size. Small-vessel disease (arterioles and microves-sels) occurs most frequently in association with systemic dis-orders such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythe-matosus, serum sickness, and other connective tissue orautoimmune diseases. Thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger’sdisease) is an arterial obliterative and thrombotic process thatis most frequently (but not invariably) observed in younge469 \n",

Of thoseindividuals with newly diagnosed lower extremity PAD,48% were asymptomatic, 46% had atypical leg pain, andonly 6% had typical claudication. In summary, the ratio ofleg symptoms in a population screened for lower extremityPAD depends on the population surveyed, the symptomassessment instrument used, and the inclusion of individualswith previously established lower extremity PAD versus pre-viously undiagnosed individuals. For most individuals withlower extremity PAD in office practices, efforts to detectearly lower extremity PAD are likely to identify individualsat high cardiovascular ischemic risk, who do not have classicclaudication, and in whom atypical leg symptoms are com-mon.\n",

Within this cohort,328 subjects (35%) had lower extremity PAD as defined byan ABI less than 0.90. Asymptomatic lower extremity PADwas common, with 63% of these individuals reporting noexertional leg pain. However, even among these individualswith asymptomatic lower extremity PAD, worsening oflower extremity function was documented by a series ofobjective measurements.

When embolic occlusion affects a vascu-lar bed not previously conditioned by collaterals, the result-ing ischemic syndrome is typically severe. Collateral devel-opment in relation to the severity and chronicity of pre-exist-ing ischemia due to atheromatous obstructive arterial diseaselessens the severity of ischemia when acute thrombotic arte-rial occlusion develops.

Embolic occlusions at sites of arterial bifur-cation may cause more profound ischemia when collateralsof perfusion are interrupted, as occurs when the profundafemoris artery is compromised by embolism to the moreproximal common femoral artery.\n",

Thelonger the obstructive lesion, the more collateral pathwaysthat are interrupted. Thrombosis tends to propagate proxi-mally in an artery, up to the next large side branch.

The intrinsic footmuscles cause movement of the toes and help support thearches of the foot.

However, the recommended frequency ofsurveillance visits depends on the burden of disease in theindividual patient, the specific procedure that was performedand its expected outcome, and the clinical syndrome forwhich the patient originally presented. Aortic and commoniliac arterial level procedures have greater durability thaninfrainguinal procedures and therefore require less frequentsurveillance. In contrast, infrainguinal revascularization forCLI, either by surgical or percutaneous methods, is associat-ed with higher restenosis and graft failure rates and thereforerequires more intense surveillance. There are inadequatedata to permit creation of consensus-based standards todefine exact time intervals for surveillance visits after eachtype of revascularization procedure. In the absence of evi-dence-based standards, the clinical time frame customarilyhas been based on the judgment of the vascular specialist, byevaluation of the specific level and type of revascularizationprocedure and by taking into account specific patient char-acteristics (Tables 12, 13, and 14). \n",

In most vascular laboratories, these bloodpressure cuffs are placed at the upper thigh, the lower thigh,the upper calf, and the lower calf above the ankle. Use of a3-cuff system (with only 1 thigh cuff) is another acceptablemethod. The systolic blood pressures obtained from thelower extremities can also be indexed relative to the brachialartery pressure, in a manner analogous to the ABI. Thesemeasurements provide a noninvasive corollary to intra-arte-rial pressure measurements. \n",

In most laboratories, a gradient of greater than 20mm Hg between adjacent segments is interpreted to repre-sent a physiologically important focal stenosis. Thus, seg-mental pressure measurements can identify the location andmagnitude of many arterial stenoses noninvasively.

      "experience with ABI testing have led to increasing use of theABI examination in office practice.

As described previ-ously, the PARTNERS investigation evaluated use of the ABIapplied to a target population of individuals aged 70 yearsand older or 50 years of age and in whom other atheroscle-rosis risk factors (especially tobacco use and diabetes) wouldbe expected to increase the prevalence of lower extremityPAD (86). The average time required to perform the ABI inprimary care office practices is approximately 15 minutes,and these ABI data are valued by clinicians (168). The utili-ty of the ABI to detect lower extremity PAD has long beenendorsed by the American Diabetes Association and theAHA, which had published an original recommendation toperform this test in individuals with insulin-dependent dia-betes who were aged 35 years and older and patients with 20years’ duration of diabetes (169). This application of the ABIto office practice has been updated by an American DiabetesAssociation consensus statement that suggested that the ABIbe performed in all individuals with diabetes who are aged50 and older, in diabetic individuals younger than age 50who have other atherosclerosis risk factors, and in individu-als with diabetes of more than 10 years’ duration (170).Application of the ABI is now considered appropriate in tar-geted populations known from the epidemiological databaseto be at risk (Table 2), including individuals 49 years of ageand younger with a history of diabetes and 1 other risk fac-tor; those 50 to 69 years of age with a history of smoking ordiabetes; those 70 years of age and older; those with anabnormal lower extremity pulse examination; and individu-als with known atherosclerotic coronary, carotid, or renalartery disease.

Normally,the pulsatility index increases from the more proximal to themore distal segments of the lower extremities (186). Adecrease in the pulsatility index between adjacent proximaland distal anatomic segments implies the presence of occlu-sive disease between these 2 locations. The degree of declinein the pulsatility index value is usually proportional to theseverity of occlusive disease (187). However, downstreamfrom moderate stenosis, the velocity pulse waveform mayrevert to a normal waveform within a short distance (approx-imately 3 to 5 vessel diameters), depending on the severityof stenosis (188,189). This latter phenomenon of “pulse nor-malization” distal to some arterial stenoses is a diagnosticlimitation. Thus, the presence of a high-resistance-typewaveform (defined as rapid forward systolic flow, followedby a short period of rapid reversed flow, and then low-veloc-ity forward flow in late diastole) does not provide irrefutableevidence of the absence of more proximal occlusive disease.\n",

Thus, there is now a wide variety ofpractice patterns with respect to the use of noninvasiveimaging modalities for therapeutic planning. At some cen-ters, it has become the standard to obtain MRA or CTAimages in advance of any invasive diagnostic studies (bar-ring a contraindication to the particular noninvasive tech-nique, such as a pacemaker, which precludes the use ofMRA). At other centers, it is still the standard that a diag-nostic angiogram is obtained with digital subtraction tech-niques before an intervention is planned. Detailed imagingalgorithms have not yet been developed that include clini-cal details from the individual patient, the modalities andexpertise available at a given site, and the relative costs.The goal of combining these imaging techniques will be tominimize risk and optimize outcome for the patient whilemaintaining economic viability for the healthcare system.Currently, contrast angiography remains the dominant\n",

      "When used for this purpose, complete imaging of the affect-ed territory is usually recommended.

From a tech-nical standpoint, the closer the catheter is to the target vesselto be imaged, the better the image definition is and the less isthe volume of contrast that is required. Accordingly, selec-tive and superselective catheter placement is useful in opti-mizing image quality.

Nonetheless, for areas where there is doubt oruncertainty regarding the presence or absence of a significantlesion, angulated views can be useful to better delineate anddefine the severity of the lesion and clarify its potential con-tribution to the clinical syndrome. This does, however,require injection of additional contrast material and prolongsthe angiographic procedure. Axial imaging techniques (e.g.,MRA and CTA) may offer an advantage for visualizing someof these eccentric, ambiguous lesions, because these tech-niques offer a 3D view.\n",

On the basis of the single compar-ative trial published to date, clopidogrel appears to be moreeffective than aspirin in preventing ischemic events in indi-viduals with symptomatic PAD (98). The combination ofclopidogrel plus aspirin versus aspirin alone has been exam-ined in patients who had presented with acute coronary syn-drome. Combination aspirin and clopidogrel therapy wasassociated with a 20% relative risk reduction for MI, stroke,or cardiovascular death (316). To date, there is no evidenceto support the efficacy of combined aspirin and clopidogreltreatment versus a single antiplatelet agent in patients with\n",

The AntithromboticTrialists’ Collaboration found that antiplatelet therapy com-pared with no additional treatment reduced the risk of arteri-al occlusion over a 19-month period by 30% (317). Onemeta-analysis that involved 54 randomized, controlled trialsin patients with intermittent claudication found that aspirincompared with placebo reduced the risk of arterial occlusion,and ticlopidine reduced the need for revascularization proce-dures (318).\n",

Meta-analyses comprising 37 trials ofanticoagulant therapy in more than 20000 patients with coro-nary artery disease evaluated the efficacy and safety of oralanticoagulation (warfarin) alone versus the control, stratifiedby intensity of anticoagulation, as well as the efficacy ofwarfarin versus aspirin in patients with coronary artery dis-ease (319,320). \n",

Comparison of moderate-to high-intensity oral anticoagulation versus aspirin found a21% odds reduction in death, MI, or stroke but was associat-ed with a 2.1-fold increased risk in major bleeding. Thus,among patients with coronary artery disease, moderate- andhigh-intensity oral anticoagulation with coumarin derivativesreduces the risk of MI and death but confers an increased rateof bleeding. One trial compared the efficacy of oral antico-agulants with aspirin on infrainguinal graft patency inpatients with lower extremity PAD.

Among those patients with PADtreated with antiplatelet therapy, there was a 22% oddsreduction for adverse cardiovascular events, including MI,stroke, or vascular death. This analysis included 42 trialscomprising 9716 patients with PAD in whom there was a23% proportional reduction in adverse cardiovascularevents. Similar benefits were realized by patients with inter-mittent claudication, those having peripheral angioplasty,and those having peripheral bypass graft procedures (314).\n",

The antiplatelet therapy used in many ofthe lower extremity PAD trials was aspirin; however, someincluded ticlopidine, a thienopyridine drug, and one includedpicotamide, a thromboxane synthase inhibitor. \n",
      "The Antithrombotic Trialists’ Collaboration meta-analysis\n",
      "also compared the efficacy of different doses of aspirin(314).

The ORs for a major extracranial bleed among patientstaking 75 to 150 mg of aspirin and those taking 160 to 325mg of aspirin daily were 1.5 and 1.4, respectively (314).Higher doses of aspirin result in increased risk of gastroin-testinal side effects and bleeding rates (315). One trial com-pared the efficacy of aspirin (325 mg daily) to the thienopy-ridine derivative clopidogrel (75 mg daily) in 19 185 patientswith a history of MI, stroke, or PAD.

Thesefunctional benefits accrue gradually and become evidentover 4 to 8 weeks and increase progressively over 12 or moreweeks. The biological mechanisms underlying such repro-ducible benefit are complex and are beyond the scope of thisguideline (132). However, there is inadequate evidence toattribute this functional benefit, as is often believed, to thegrowth of new collaterals (angiogenesis); in contrast, clinicalimprovement is more likely to be due to alterations in skele-tal muscle metabolism, muscle hypertrophy, improvementsin endothelial function, or altered gait. \n",

A meta-analysis of 21 studies byGardner and Poehlman included both nonrandomized andrandomized trials of exercise training and showed that pain-free walking time improved by an average of 180% and max-imal walking time increased by 120% in claudicationpatients who underwent exercise training (323). This meta-analysis also provided data to summarize clinical predictorsof responsiveness to exercise interventions. The greatestimprovements in walking ability occurred when each exer-cise session lasted longer than 30 minutes, when sessionstook place at least 3 times per week, when the exercisemodality used was walking to near-maximal pain, and whenthe program lasted 6 months or longer. A meta-analysis fromthe Cochrane Collaboration that considered only random-ized, controlled trials concluded that exercise improved max-imal walking ability by an average of 150% (range 74% to230%) (329). \n",

Exercise-induced improvements in walking ability translate to increas-es in routine daily activity (199,339). In one uncontrolledstudy by Gardner et al., 6 months of exercise trainingimproved treadmill walking ability, accompanied by a 31%increase in routine daily activity as measured by accelerom-etry (199). Self-reported physical activity increased by 62%,which confirms that patients themselves appreciated thisfunctional improvement. Controlled studies have alsodemonstrated higher levels of routine daily activity inpatients with claudication after exercise training (340). Suchsustained increases in physical activity, if associated withimprovements in cardiovascular risk factors, have the poten-tial to reduce the risk of cardiovascular ischemic events,thereby potentially improving the poor prognosis for survivalin this population (341,342). \n",

However, there is no evi-dence that patients with claudication need to undergo stressimaging or invasive angiographic studies before initiating anexercise program. Such safety has been maintained, withserious adverse events rarely documented in clinical practiceor in research investigations, by prudent application of aninitial standard treadmill exercise test. This test should beperformed with 12-lead electrocardiographic monitoringbefore a therapeutic exercise program is initiated, so thatischemic symptoms, ST–T-wave changes, or arrhythmiasmay be identified (345). Although these patients will, by def-inition, have claudication-limited exercise (and thereforewill not achieve a true maximal exercise performance), thefindings from the exercise test can be used to determine thatthere are no untoward cardiovascular responses at the exer-cise level reached. The exercise test also provides informa-tion about claudication thresholds and heart rate and bloodpressure responses for establishing an exercise prescription.Patient enrollment in a medically supervised exercise pro-gram with electrocardiographic, heart rate, blood pressure,and blood glucose monitoring is encouraged. It is also pru-dent to use monitoring routinely during the initial exercisesessions; individual clinical responses then would determinethe need for monitoring in subsequent sessions. Many car-diac rehabilitation exercise programs can accommodatepatients with claudication, providing an environment con-ducive for “lifestyle change” that underlies long-term com-pliance to exercise and risk factor modification. \n",

These drugs have been shown to promote collat-eral blood vessel formation and increase limb blood flow inexperimental models of hindlimb ischemia (390,391).Angiogenic growth factors have been administered asrecombinant proteins or via gene transfer with naked plasmidDNA or adenoviral vectors encoding the angiogenic growthfactor (392,393). In a small phase 1, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, administration of bFGF via the femoralartery on 1 or 2 consecutive days increased calf blood flow 1month and 6 months later (394). In a randomized, placebo-controlled study, intra-arterial administration of recombinantfibroblast growth factor–2 at a dose of 30 micrograms perkilogram on 1 occasion increased peak walking time at 90days by 19%, although its administration on 2 occasions 30days apart did not significantly improve peak walking timecompared with placebo (395). There have been no significantadverse events reported in patients treated with recombinantfibroblast growth factor–2 compared with those receivingplacebo. One study that involved the intravenous administra-tion of bFGF to patients with claudication was terminatedprematurely when 4 of 16 subjects who received bFGFdeveloped proteinuria that exceeded 1 g per 24 hours (396).A small phase 1 study examined the safety and efficacy ofintramuscular administration of an adenoviral VEGF isoform121 and monitored patients for up to 1 year (397).

      "(448) and Wolfe et al. (446) both excluded patients withlong-segment disease (greater than 6 cm and greater than 10cm, respectively). In these trials, patients had to be consid-ered candidates for either PTA or surgical bypass, and it islikely that patients with poor prognostic factors for PTA werenot included. In the study by Holm et al., only 5% of patientsconsidered for revascularization were actually entered intothe study (446). Therefore, these results cannot be general-ized to patients with poor prognostic factors for PTA. Forexample, patients with long-segment superficial femoralartery disease and poor runoff have had dismal outcomeswith endovascular therapy (449). A cost-effectiveness analy-sis compared PTA and bypass surgery with exercise therapyfor treatment of claudication. The cost-effectiveness of PTA\n",
      "was $38 000 per quality-adjusted life year, which is in the\n",
      "range of other accepted procedures. Bypass surgery cost-effectiveness was $311 000 per quality-adjusted life-year(450). \n",
      "Effectiveness is strongly affected by the severity of patient\n",
      "symptoms before revascularization and severity of disease.For femoral-popliteal disease, PTA was more cost-effectivethan surgical bypass for the treatment of claudication (steno-sis and occlusion) and for treatment of CLI (stenosis only).Surgical bypass was more cost-effective for treatment of CLIfor occlusions (438). Percutaneous transluminal angioplastywould always be the preferred initial treatment if the PTA 5-year patency rate exceeded 30%. Another model of cost-effectiveness of iliac artery PTA versus supervised exercisehas suggested that exercise might offer greater cost-effec-tiveness (as measured by dollars per meter gained) than pri-mary iliac artery angioplasty (451). Overall, the relative clin-ical and health economic benefits of each claudication thera-py must be considered in light of the individual clinical char-acteristics of each patient. \n",
      "Selection of patients for iliac artery PTA or stenting has\n",
      "been addressed in 1 randomized trial and 1 meta-analysis ofcase series. The Dutch iliac stent trial compared iliac stentingas primary therapy (primary stenting) to PTA with immedi-ate stenting (provisional stenting) for PTA failures, definedas greater than 10 mm of mean arterial pressure gradient withor without vasodilators. Forty-three percent of the PTA grouprequired stents. Complications, 1-year patency, and clinicaloutcomes were similar, which indicates that provisionalstenting and primary stenting are equally safe and effective(452). Another randomized trial was suggestive of superiori-ty for primary stenting (453). In a meta-analysis, iliac arterystenting was found to have a higher technical success andlong-term patency than PTA, with a similar complication rate(436). Similar to the Dutch iliac stent trial, the meta-analysisshowed parallel life-table outcomes of patency after the ini-tial technical failures of PTA, which indicates that a good ini-tial result from iliac PTA is as durable as iliac stenting.Provisional stenting treats the initial technical failures ofPTA and is more cost-effective than PTA alone (454,455);however, in routine clinical practice, most iliac lesions aretreated with primary stenting.

The 4 randomized trials have uniformly found no dif-ference in patency, ABI, or clinical improvement when com-paring stents and PTA alone (457-460). A fifth randomizedtrial that resulted in an FDA label for 1 stent for primaryfemoral/popliteal stenting similarly showed no difference inoutcomes between stenting and PTA. Stenting does have ahigher technical success rate (457) and may have a role insalvage of an immediate PTA failure and in treatment ofrecurrent stenosis after PTA (461). \n",
      "Other techniques of endovascular revascularization have\n",
      "shown no advantages over PTA/stents. A randomized trial of\n",
      "atherectomy versus PTA for treatment of femoropoplitealdisease showed worse 2-year patency and clinical and hemo-dynamic success for atherectomy (462). Another randomizedtrial of atherectomy versus PTA showed no difference in 6-month patency (463). A case series of atherectomy for treat-ment of tibial lesions had dismal results (464). Similarly,multiple randomized trials of laser angioplasty versus PTAhave shown no advantage of laser therapy (465-468).Investigational randomized trials suggest that endovascularbrachytherapy may reduce restenosis rates of PTA and stent-ing in the femoral-popliteal arteries (469-473). Techniques tobe investigated in randomized trials in the peripheral circula-tion include fabric-covered stents (474,475) and drug-coatedstents (476,477).\n",
      "The use of antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants to\n",

A meta-analysis reported increased patency and alower amputation rate with use of antiplatelet drugs afterPTA (478), but a review of 11 randomized trials found no dif-ference in preventing reocclusion after PTA using aspirin ororal anticoagulants (479).\n",
      "On the basis of the above-reported outcomes of PTA/stent-\n",
      "ing and surgery, consensus recommendations for selection ofpatients for endovascular therapy in the management oflower-limb peripheral arterial occlusion were made by aninternational panel (1). The superiority of surgery versusstenting for TASC type B and C iliac lesions was confirmedin a case series, with poor runoff being the strongest prog-nostic factor for stenting failure (480). For femoral-popliteallesions, Clark et al. found that AHA category 2 and 3 lesions(similar to TASC type B and C) had nearly identical 36-month patency (69% and 66%), whereas category 1 lesionshad a 36-month patency rate of 87% (423). Selection ofpatients for endovascular therapy should be based on TASCanatomic classifications, as well as severity of patient symp-toms, comorbid conditions, and risks of surgical revascular-ization. The summary consensus recommendations of TASCfor indications for aortoiliac revascularization for claudica-tion suggest endovascular procedures as the treatment ofchoice for type A lesions and surgical procedures as the treat-ment of choice for type D lesions.e520\n",

Mostcommonly, patients demonstrate diffuse disease of theinfrarenal aorta and iliac vessels, with the lesions of greatesthemodynamic consequence located in the iliac arteries. Themost effective surgical procedure for the treatment for thispattern of atherosclerotic occlusive disease is aortobifemoralbypass. Through a transabdominal or retroperitonealapproach, this bypass is constructed by sewing the proximalend of a bifurcated polyester filament or PTFE graft, usuallyend-to-end, to the aorta immediately below the origins of therenal arteries. The distal graft limbs are sewn to the distalcommon femoral arteries or onto the proximal deep femoralarteries, if the superficial femoral arteries are occluded, toprovide adequate outflow for the graft limbs and improvedcollateral flow to the popliteal arteries. \n",
      "Aortobifemoral grafting is associated with an operative\n",
      "mortality of 3.3% and a morbidity of 8.3% (485). Major mor-bidity is most commonly due to MI (0.8% to 5.2%) or renalfailure (0% to 4.6%) (536,601). The expected patency of aor-tobifemoral bypass as the sole procedure for the treatment ofCLI is excellent. A meta-analysis of major studies publishedafter 1975 reported a limb-based 5-year primary patency rateof 87.5% and a patient-based 5-year patency of 80.4% (485).This changed little in the subsequent 5 years, with a limb-based 10-year patency rate of 81.8% and a patient-based 10-year patency of 72.1%. The site of distal anastomosis,whether to the common femoral artery when the superficialfemoral artery is open or to the profunda femoris artery whenthe superficial femoral artery is occluded, has little impact.In a report of a large series of predominantly limb-salvagepatients, 5-year patency was 89% for grafts placed to thecommon femoral artery and 92% for grafts placed to the pro-funda femoris artery (601). tic bifurcation, localized aortoiliac endarterectomy may bee  531\n",

In its absence,PTFE or polyester filament may be used with an expectedlower but acceptable patency rate for above-knee bypasses.Patency of prosthetic grafts is significantly lower once theknee joint is crossed. In a meta-analysis of reported data on1572 patients, Hunink and colleagues noted a 5-year patencyrate of 47% for prosthetic grafts to the above-knee poplitealartery and a patency rate of only 33% when grafts werebrought down to the below-knee popliteal artery (437).

Bypasses to the tibial arteries with pros-thetic material should be avoided and other sources of auto-genous vein sought if the ipsilateral greater saphenous veinis absent or unsuitable. Lesser saphenous vein, contralateralgreater saphenous vein, arm vein, and spliced veins may beused, with an expected patency greater than prosthetic mate-rial. When vein length is inadequate, a composite sequentialgraft consisting of a prosthetic graft to the above-kneepopliteal artery and a jump graft of autogenous vein to thedistal vessel may be used. If no other option exists, then theuse of a prosthetic with an adjunctive procedure, such asarteriovenous fistula or vein interposition or cuff, mayimprove patency, although this has not been clearly proven. The least-diseased tibial or pedal artery with continuous flowto the foot should be used as the outflow vessel for the con-struction of a distal bypass, because equivalent results can beachieved with all tibial and even pedal arteries (606,607).Diabetes mellitus does not have a significant negative impacton distal revascularization (497). It is most important toachieve direct and uncompromised outflow to the foot.The operative mortality of lower extremity revascularizationin this often critically ill population of patients ranges from1% to 6% regardless of the specific graft configuration(499,500,505,608). In a meta-analysis of reports for lowerextremity revascularization composed of at least 50% ofpatients with CLI, there was a 70% 5-year patency rate forfemorotibial grafts created with vein but only a 27% patencyrate for those created with a prosthetic material (601).\n",

In such cases, the atrophy should be otherwiseunexplained by a prior history of pyelonephritis, refluxnephropathy, trauma, and so on. When such a history is pres-ent, there is usually not an indication for additional renaldiagnostic tests to define RAS. These clinical indications areoutlined in Figure 17.\n",
      "3.3. Pathophysiology and Disease Categories\n",
      "The pathophysiology that results from RAS is mediated by\n",
      "the degree of renal blood flow impairment. In the acutephase, unilateral RAS causes a renin-mediated (vasocon-\n",
      "striction) form of hypertension, although renin increases may\n",
      "be moderated in the chronic phase of renal hypertension. Incontrast, the effects of bilateral renal artery stenoses or steno-sis to a solitary kidney are predominantly due to an increase\n",
      "in extracellular fluid volume. Exceptions to this include\n",
      "longstanding unilateral RAS and contralateral renal dysfunc-tion (e.g., due to hypertensive nephrosclerosis or hyperfiltra-tion injury) wherein the physiology mimics that of a patientwith a single functioning kidney or those with bilateral dis-ease. Inasmuch as renal blood flow and filtration rate aremaintained, in part, by angiotensin II-induced efferent arteri-\n",

      "dilation, such as ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptorblockers, can cause acute renal failure. They do so bydecreasing transglomerular hydrostatic pressure and thusglomerular filtration rate. In addition, because the glomeru-lar filtration rate falls but renal blood flow changes very lit-tle, the filtration fraction decreases. Under these circum-stances, blood is shunted from the afferent arteriole to theefferent arteriole because there is not an adequate hydrostat-ic pressure to maintain filtration. Thus, use of ACE inhibitorsor angiotensin receptor-blocking medications in patientswith bilateral RAS, stenosis to a solitary kidney, or decom-pensated congestive heart failure in a sodium-depleted statecan result in acute renal failure (649-652).

Duplex renal sonography, because of the critical role ofthe sonographer, is accurate in experienced laboratories andis thus ideally performed in high-volume accredited labora-tories. The diagnostic accuracy of these ultrasound-basedexaminations is further limited in patients with large bodyhabitus or intestinal gas obscuring visualization of the entire-ty of the renal artery.

Unilateral RASmay contribute to the development of unstable coronary syn-dromes by causing sudden increases in myocardial oxygendemand in patients with coronary disease secondary toperipheral vasoconstriction; this mechanism is distinct fromthe usual assumption underlying other mechanisms of acutecoronary syndromes (e.g., plaque rupture or progressive ath-erosclerosis) (764,765). \n",

The contribution of procedure-related renal arteryatheroembolization to decrements in renal function afterrevascularization can be difficult to quantitate and distin-guish from the nephrotoxic effects of iodinated contrast, par-ticularly in patients with initially elevated serum creatinineand limited renal reserve. These potential limitations empha-size the need for preprocedural volume expansion and strictuse of contrast-sparing techniques (e.g., highly diluted con-trast), the use of alternative agents (e.g., carbon dioxide orgadolinium), preprocedure oral acetylcysteine administra-tion, and high levels of operator experience when revascu-larization is performed in individuals with renal insufficien-cy. In a preliminary study, Henry and coworkers used embol-ic protection devices during percutaneous renal revascular-ization and demonstrated atheroembolic debris in all 32arteries treated (755). The value of embolic protectiondevices is being tested in clinical trials to determine whetherthese devices can decrease (or increase) the frequency ofclinically important atheroemboli to the kidneys.

(945) were among the first to recognize thatthe risk for spontaneous rupture was a direct function ofaneurysm size. Others have since discovered that additionalfactors also may influence the rupture rate, such as hyperten-sion (946,947), COPD and/or tobacco abuse (946-949),female gender (882,947), and a family history of aorticaneurysms, particularly when a woman with an aorticaneurysm is present in the proband (882). Nevertheless,aneurysm size remains the single most important predictornot only for aneurysm rupture, but also for unrelated deathfrom other cardiopulmonary events (932,950).\n",
      "Table 47 contains representative data regarding aneurysm\n",
      "rupture rates and long-term patient survival rates accordingto the baseline diameter of AAAs at the time of their discov-ery. These data suggest that the eventual risk for rupture isapproximately 20% for aneurysms that measure larger than5.0 cm in diameter, 40% for those measuring at least 6.0 cmin diameter, and higher than 50% for aneurysms that exceed7.0 cm in diameter. Taylor and Porter interpreted earlier datato indicate that the annual rupture rates for aneurysms ofthese sizes were in the range of 4%, 7%, and 20%, respec-tively (938). Conversely, the rupture rate for truly smallaneurysms that are less than 4.0 cm in diameter is quite low,perhaps because aged patients with such small aneurysmsordinarily do not survive long enough for this complicationto occur. Watson et al. found that more patients with smallaneurysms died of other causes than ever required surgicaltreatment for enlarging aneurysms (951). Bengtsson et al.have recommended only 1 annual follow-up scan foraneurysms less than 3.5 cm in diameter because the unrelat-ed mortality rate in such patients is so high that relatively fewlive long enough to incur sufficient aneurysm growth to war-rant elective surgical treatment (931). Prospective nonran-domized studies have indicated that small aneurysms may besafely monitored by annual or semiannual imaging scans,with a low risk for rupture, provided elective repair isadvised once a diameter of at least 5.0 cm has been docu-mented (952,953).

A study of screening for AAAs in3000 of 6058 males aged 64 to 81 years was underpoweredto demonstrate a reduction in mortality through selectiverescreening or surgical intervention for AAAs (1034). In acohort of 52 745 military veterans aged 50 to 79 years whohad no history of aneurysms, AAAs measuring 4.0 cm orlarger in diameter were detected by ultrasound screening in613 participants (1.2%). When this cohort was combinedwith a similar cohort of 73 451 veterans in the same agerange, the ORs for major risk factors were as follows: 1.71per 7 years of age, 0.18 for female gender, 0.53 for blackrace, 1.94 for family history of AAA, 5.07 for smoking, 0.52for diabetes, and 1.66 for atherosclerotic diseases. Theexcess prevalence associated with smoking accounted for75% of all AAAs 4.0 cm or larger in the combined popula-tion of 126 196 veterans. The risk factor associations forsmaller AAAs (3.0 to 3.9 cm) were similar but less robust(870). According to one estimate, if the risk for AAA werebased on age alone, it would be necessary to examine overhalf of the elderly male population to obtain 80% of the totalpotential benefit among men. If age and smoking wereincluded, the proportion needed to screen would fall to 35%.Even if other risk factors, such as coronary disease or hyper-lipidemia, were included, it still would be necessary toscreen 15% to 20% of the population, and the cost would beprohibitive (1035). \n",

Such factors undoubtedly accountfor some of the variability in the representative early out-comes that are summarized in Table 49. Mortality rates fromsingle centers generally were in the range of 4% to 5% dur-ing the 1980s, whereas information that has been publishedduring the 1990s contains several series in which the mortal-ity rate has declined to less than 2%.

      "bases, such as the National Hospital Discharge Survey(NHDS) and the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, are intriguingbecause of their potential sample size but often require con-siderable editing to distinguish between infrarenal andsuprarenal aortic aneurysms, both of which are classifiedunder the same ICD-9 (International Classification ofDiseases, 9th Revision) code. Lawrence et al. (1075) usedthe NHDS to calculate an operative mortality rate of 8.4%for 32387 patients in 1994, but as indicated in Table 49, con-flicting results can be generated from the NHDS and theNationwide Inpatient Sample during similar periods of study(1075-1078). In comparison, the operative mortality rate foropen repair of ruptured AAAs is uniformly grim, rangingfrom 40% to 70% regardless of whether it has been reportedfrom single-center case series, collective reviews, regional ormulticenter studies, or large national databases (Table 50). \n",
      "The clinical variables that significantly influence the mor-\n",

These include a low initial hematocrit, hypotension thatrequires resuscitation, cardiac arrest, a high APACHE (AcutePhysiological And Chronic Health Evaluation) score, andadvanced age (1097,1100,1101,1103-1105). In comparison,certain patient demographics and organ-specific factors takeprecedence over hemodynamic instability in the determina-tion of the surgical risk for elective repair of intactaneurysms.

This has resulted in a distinct shift in the paradigmfor management of infrarenal aortic aneurysms in some geo-graphic areas during a relatively short period of time.According to statewide data from New York, for example,53% of patients who underwent AAA repair received endo-grafts in 2002 compared with 40% in 2001 (1135).\n",

      "place, the design of aortic stent grafts has passed throughseveral iterations. Most contemporary stent grafts are sup-ported by a metallic skeleton that is secured to the fabric ofthe graft during the manufacturing process to maintain linearstability once the device has been implanted and to avoidkinking that can result in graft limb occlusion with unsup-ported grafts. To better accommodate the aortoiliac anatomyand facilitate graft deployment, the majority of modern endo-grafts also are modular in construction. Thus, the aortic stemand a contiguous iliac limb are inserted through 1 femoralartery, with the opposite iliac limb then being positioned bya separate delivery system through the contralateral femoralartery. The absence of an adequate length of relatively nor-mal aorta below the renal arteries historically has excludedpatients from consideration for endovascular repair becauseof the high risk for proximal attachment failure, graft migra-tion, and endoleak. \n",

In aggregate,modular externally supported bifurcation endografts aremore widely applicable, less prone to migrate from their sitesof attachment, and more likely to remain patent than was thecase with the first generation of unsupported endografts onlya few years ago.

According toEuropean collaborators registry on stent-graft techniques forabdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EUROSTAR) data forfollow-up intervals as long as 6 years, the presence of type IIendoleaks has not been associated with a significant inci-dence of any adverse clinical events other than the secondaryinterventions that are performed at the discretion of theattending physicians (1150).

      "Aside from their infrequent other complications (e.g., periph-eral or visceral embolism, aortocaval or primary aortoentericfistula), the single most compelling reason to repair AAAs isto prevent fatal rupture. The first step in this process is toidentify the presence of these aneurysms, beginning with athorough physical examination or their recognition as anincidental finding on unrelated abdominal imaging studies.This is especially important in certain high-prevalence popu-lations, such as those with known popliteal aneurysms or afamily history of aortic aneurysms. The next step is to estab-lish, on the basis of ultrasonography or computed tomogra-phy/magnetic resonance scanning, whether a particular aor-tic aneurysm already is large enough to warrant interventionor instead should be placed under periodic surveillance todetermine its rate of expansion. Brown et al. have shown ina prospective but nonrandomized study that observationalone is a safe approach until an aneurysm undergoes agrowth spurt or attains a threshold diameter of 5.0 cm (952).The success of watchful waiting is predicated on patientcooperation, however. In a similar study of 101 patients withaneurysms measuring less than 5.0 cm in diameter, Valentineet al. encountered no ruptures among patients who compliedwith their follow-up program compared with a 10% rupturerate among those who did not (1217). If continued surveil-lance is recommended, measures should be taken to controlhypertension and to discourage smoking, because these riskfactors are associated with accelerated rates of aneurysm\n",

      "patients who underwent endovascular repair of AAAs witheither investigational or commercially available stent graftsat a single center during a 6-year period of study beginningin 1996 (1204). First, certain complications (i.e., graft limbocclusions, fabric tears, and type II endoleaks) appeared tooccur more commonly with some grafts than with others andtherefore may be device-specific (1204).

Peppelenbosch et al. found thatEUROSTAR patients with aneurysms larger than 5.4 cm indiameter were more likely to be older and to have more pre-operative risk factors, early complications, and late unrelateddeaths than patients with smaller aneurysms (1191). In addi-tion, large aneurysms often were associated with arterialanatomy (such as angulated or ectatic infrarenal necks andiliac aneurysms) that was less favorable for endograft repairand probably contributed to the significantly higher overallincidence of type I endoleaks, conversion to open surgicalrepair, and late rupture and/or aneurysm-related deaths thatwere documented in the group of patients who had largeaneurysms. In another study of endograft repair in 245patients (42 women), Shames et al. also determined that graftlimb occlusions were more common among women (12% vs.2.5%, pequals 0.05) (1180).

It must be conceded from the outset that therecould be honest scientific disagreement regarding a few ofthe recommended pathways that are illustrated in this algo-rithm. Some clinicians may be convinced that infrarenalaneurysms should continue to be repaired at a size of only5.0 cm or larger, whereas others could believe that the con-clusions of the UK and V A trials are not directly applicableto aortic aneurysms that involve the renal arteries and thatthese aneurysms should be even larger than 5.5 cm in diam-eter before elective surgical treatment is advised, to warrantits additional risks. In addition, there undoubtedly are manywho believe that the present technology of endovascularrepair is at a state of development that justifies its general usein low- and average-risk patients and in those who appear tobe at high risk for conventional open operations. There isnothing unfavorable about its early safety to discourage thisopinion. As an example from northern California andNevada, proctored endovascular aneurysm repair was under-taken at 22 community hospitals in a series of 257 patients,only 29% of whom had medical contraindications to con-ventional operations, with 2 immediate open conversions anda 30-day mortality rate of 1.2% (1218). However, this reportshares the current liability of many studies concerning aorticstent grafts. The mean follow-up period for these patientswas only 9.6 months, during which another 8% of themrequired reintervention.\n",

The technical success rate for these nonsurgi-cal options ranges from 67% to 100%, with few fatalities orcomplications (850,1232,1233). One concern that should berecognized related to the catheter-based management of vis-ceral artery aneurysms is the limited ability to assess the endorgan after aneurysm treatment. This is in contrast to opensurgical visceral artery aneurysm repair, in which the endorgan may be visualized and assessed, a point that appears tobe especially important in the treatment of mesenteric arteryaneurysms, for which there is potential risk for bowelischemia.

According to a collectivereview of the literature that was conducted by Dawson et al.(1249), these complications still occur in 36% of patientswhose popliteal aneurysms are merely placed under observa-tion, a figure that is remarkably similar to the late complica-tion rate of 34% that was reported by Gifford and his associ-ates more than 40 years earlier. Furthermore, Dawson et al.also found that the cumulative incidence of ischemic com-plications was as high as 70% during 5 to 10 years of follow-up for popliteal aneurysms that were evaluated at their owncenter (1250,1251).\n",

In fact, there is a pub-lished consensus that small popliteal aneurysms rarelybecome symptomatic and that elective surgical interventionshould be considered only for those measuring at least 2.0cm in diameter (1245,1254,1255). Stiegler et al. have report-ed a series of 46 patients who had 65 popliteal arteryaneurysms with a mean diameter of 1.9 cm (range 0.8 to 4.0cm); the aneurysms were occluded at the time of their dis-covery in only 8 patients (mean diameter 2.4 cm, range 1.4to 4.0 cm) (1257). Thirty-six patients with 46 aneurysmswere observed over a period of 2.5 years. The total compli-cation rate was 6.5%, with a higher incidence in patientswhose aneurysms were larger than 2.0 cm in diameter (14%vs. 3.1%). Complications also appeared to occur more fre-quently (14% vs. 0%) in the 19 patients who were treatedwith platelet-inhibitor drugs than in 16 others who receivedcoumarin anticoagulation. The mean increase in diameterduring follow-up was 1.5 mm per year for aneurysms largerthan 2.0 cm versus 0.7 mm per year for smaller aneurysms.In another regional survey of 19 vascular surgeons who con-tributed data for 200 popliteal aneurysms in 137 patients dur-ing a 4-year period of study, Varga et al. determined that 31%of small, untreated aneurysms eventually required surgicalintervention because of the onset of new symptoms or expan-sion to a diameter that exceeded 2.0 cm while under surveil-lance (968).e604\n",

      "Evidence before this study\n",
      "Occupational heat strain directly threatens workers’ ability to live healthy and productive lives. To date, the magnitude of this problem has not been systematically investigated. To fill this knowledge gap, we completed the first systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the effects of occupational heat strain on workers’ health and productivity outcomes. We searched PubMed and Embase from the date of their inception to Feb 5, 2018, for studies in any labour environment, with no restrictions on language, workers’ health status, or study design. We did six random-effects meta-analyses to estimate the effect of occupational heat strain on different health and productivity outcomes. In total, 111 studies done in 30 countries, including more than 447 million workers from over 40 different occupations, were eligible for analysis.\n",
      "Added value of this study\n",
      "This study estimated that individuals working a single work shift under heat stress are four times more likely to experience occupational heat strain, while their core temperature is increased by 0·7°C and their urine specific gravity is increased by 14·5%. Of those individuals who work under heat stress, 35% experience occupational heat strain, while 30% report productivity losses. Finally, 15% of individuals who typically work under heat stress experience kidney disease or acute kidney injury.\n",
      "Implications of all the available evidence\n",
      "Occupational heat strain has important effects on health and productivity outcomes and should be recognised globally as a public health problem. Concerted international action is needed to mitigate its effects in light of the occurring climate change and the anticipated rise in heat stress. Efforts should be made towards establishing a surveillance system, which will provide a basis for public health policy, health-care planning, and resource allocation for occupational heat strain prevention initiatives.\n",

      "increased the total number of cases in our qualitative and quantitative data synthesis. However, our analysis is not without its limitations. First, some studies included in the meta-analyses for the prevalence of occupational heat strain, kidney disease, and productivity loss used self-reported tools to assess symptoms or productivity loss and, therefore, are susceptible to reporting and recall bias. Therefore, our reported prevalence rates might be overestimated or underestimated. Yet, these studies included representative and large samples, which limits the potential for error in their estimates. Second, the devices and methods used to assess core temperature and urine specific gravity vary across the included studies. However, the adopted methods are well accepted, which minimises this bias. Third, many of the analysed studies did not provide exact WBGT or air temperature values as thresholds for occupational heat strain. To address this issue, we report the ranges of WBGT or air temperature for all the studies in which such data are provided. Fourth, the studies included in our meta-analyses were typically regionally confined and were done in cases where a high prevalence or effect was expected. Therefore, the effects reported in this study might not apply in cold regions, seasons, and jobs that are not associated with occupational heat strain or workplace heat exposure. Nonetheless, this study used the best available data and provides working estimates on the effects of occupational heat strain on workers’ health and productivity outcomes across 30 countries and many occupations. These data provide useful indicators of the public health burden of occupational heat strain and provide a basis for health and safety policy and for relevant prevention initiatives.\n",
      "Our findings show that occupational heat strain, a fully \n",
      "preventable condition, has important health and productivity outcomes and should be recognised as a public health problem. Concerted international action is needed to mitigate the effects of occupational heat strain, particularly in light of climate change and the anticipated rise in environmental heat stress. The presented evidence shows the urgent need to establish a surveillance system to monitor prevalence of occupational heat strain throughout the world. At the same time, increased efforts should be made to educate workers and employers about the health and performance effects of occupational heat strain, and appropriate screening protocols should be incorporated within health and safety legislation. Importantly, physicians and other health-care providers can play a crucial part in the primary prevention and management of occupational heat strain.\n",
