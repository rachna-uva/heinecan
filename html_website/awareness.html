          <h2 class="section-title">Understanding Heat Stress at Work</h2>
          <p>Heat stress occurs when the body cannot cool itself adequately during exposure to high temperatures. In industrial environments like breweries, logistics centers, or outdoor work zones, this risk is intensified. This is especially during summer or in tropical regions.</p>

        <section>
          <h2 class="section-title">What Is Heat Stress?</h2>
          <p>Heat stress is the body’s response to excessive heat. It can cause physical exhaustion, dehydration, and even life-threatening conditions like heatstroke. The Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) is used to assess this risk by combining temperature, humidity, and wind speed.</p>

          <h2 class="section-title">How to Stay Safe</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Hydration:</strong> Drink one cup of water (250 ml) every 15 to 20 minutes. It is not safe to consume more than 6 cups (about 1.5 liters) per hour.</li>
            <li><strong>Cooling:</strong> Take breaks in shaded/cool areas, and use fans or cool packs.</li>
            <li><strong>Clothing:</strong> Wear lightweight, breathable clothing.</li>
            <li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> Use the HSMD dashboard to monitor conditions and follow mitigation guidelines.</li>
